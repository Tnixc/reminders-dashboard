# Theme Configuration Fix - Migration Guide

## What Was Fixed

The theme color configuration was not being read properly from the config file due to a structural issue in how the TOML parser was handling nested color configurations.

### Issue
The `ColorThemeConfig` struct had an unnecessary wrapper with an `Inline` field that was causing confusion in how colors were accessed. This meant that even though users specified colors in their config files, they weren't being applied.

### Solution
Simplified the `ColorThemeConfig` structure by making it a direct type alias to `ColorTheme`, removing the intermediate wrapper. This allows the TOML parser to correctly unmarshal the color values.

## Changes Made

### 1. Config Structure Simplification
**File**: `internal/config/parser.go`

**Before**:
```go
type ColorThemeConfig struct {
    Inline ColorTheme `toml:",inline"`
}
```

**After**:
```go
type ColorThemeConfig = ColorTheme
```

### 2. Theme Parser Updates
**File**: `internal/tui/theme/theme.go`

- Removed mutation of global `DefaultTheme` variable
- Fixed color field access from `cfg.Theme.Colors.Inline.Text.Primary` to `cfg.Theme.Colors.Text.Primary`
- Added better debug logging to help diagnose configuration issues
- Created `getDefaultTheme()` function to return fresh defaults each time

### 3. Removed Git/Contributor Colors
Since this is a reminders dashboard (not a GitHub PR dashboard), we removed all contributor-related icon colors:

- Removed `ColorThemeIcon` struct
- Removed `IconTheme` and `IconThemeConfig` structs
- Updated `GetAuthorRoleIcon()` to use theme text colors instead of specialized icon colors

## How to Verify Your Config is Working

### Option 1: Use the Test Config Reader
```bash
cd reminders-dashboard
go run testing/test-config-reader.go ~/.config/reminders-dashboard/config.toml
```

This will display all your configuration values, including theme colors. Look for the "Theme Colors" section to verify your colors are being read.

### Option 2: Check Debug Logs
Run your application with debug logging enabled to see the parsed theme values.

## Your Config File Should Look Like This

```toml
[theme.colors.text]
primary = "#c6d0f5"
secondary = "#b5bfe2"
faint = "#a5adce"
inverted = "#303446"
success = "#a6d189"
warning = "#ef9f76"
error = "#e78284"

[theme.colors.background]
selected = "#414559"

[theme.colors.border]
primary = "#626880"
secondary = "#51576d"
faint = "#414559"
```

**Note**: Do NOT use `theme.colors.icon.*` - these fields have been removed as they were git-specific and not used in a reminders dashboard.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Colors from config file are applied**: Your custom colors from the config file will now be properly loaded and used throughout the application.

2. **Urgency gradient works**: Due dates will be colored based on urgency:
   - ðŸ”´ Red: Overdue or due within 24 hours
   - ðŸŸ  Orange: Due within 48 hours
   - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Due within 1 week
   - âšª Grey: Due later than 1 week

3. **Hover effects work**: When you hover over a reminder:
   - Title becomes bold
   - Title uses the primary text color
   - Background uses the selected background color

## Migration Notes

If you had a config file before this fix:

1. **Remove any `[theme.colors.icon]` section** - It's no longer used
2. **Keep your color definitions as-is** - They should now work correctly
3. **Test with the config reader** - Verify colors are being loaded

## Troubleshooting

**Colors still not showing?**
- Run the test config reader to verify parsing
- Check for TOML syntax errors in your config
- Ensure hex colors start with `#`
- Make sure your terminal supports true color

**Getting errors about "Inline" field?**
- You're using an old version - rebuild the application
- Clear any cached builds: `go clean -cache`

**Want to reset to defaults?**
- Remove the `[theme.colors]` section from your config
- Or delete your config file and let it regenerate
